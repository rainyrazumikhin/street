            <img style = "width: 50%; margin-top: 40px; margin-left: 20px;" src="img/bifana.webp" alt="">
            <p>One of the most popular options when it comes to street food in Portugal is sandwiches, and one can not go wrong with Bifana - the delicious pork sandwich. Even though the snack differs slightly depending on the region, it is usually made with pork seasoned with garlic and spices, and a bread roll, also known as papo seco adding up to the simplest but the most delicious combo.</p>
            <h3>ZAPIENKANKA</h3>
            <img style = "width: 50%; margin-top: 40px; margin-left: 20px;" src="img/Zapiekanka.jpeg" alt="">
            <p>Although this dish made its first appearance in the 1970s, Zapiekanka is still considered a trendy must-have thanks to a new wave of passionate food-lovers. People used to improvise whatever ingredients they had on their hands to make this dish back in the day. To make a perfect Polish pizza, the locals will top the bread with sliced, sautéed white mushrooms and grated cheese, then toast until the bread is crisp and the cheese melts. A flavorful mushroom bread covered under a coat of melted cheese, who can say no to that?

            <h3>PACZKI</h3>
            <img style = "width: 50%; margin-top: 40px; margin-left: 20px;" src="img/paczki.jpeg" alt="">
            <p>These mouth-watering Polish donuts can be found almost everywhere in Warsaw, and all of them are delicious in their own ways. However, the donuts from Górczewska Street had won the title for the best Paczki in this city. Since the Middle Ages, Paczki has been a popular treat in Poland. During the reign of Augustus III, thanks to the influence of French cooks who came to Poland, Paczki became much lighter and spongier</p>
