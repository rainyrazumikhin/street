                    <p>If you’re looking for unique, wholesome, and authentic food when in Italy, Italian street food will open up your culinary intrigue to a world of history and flavor far beyond the bubble of restaurants and fine dining.</p> <br><br><br><hr><!--source:https://nomadparadise.com/italian-street-food/-->

            <h3>ARANCINI</h3>
            <img style = "width: 50%; margin-top: 40px; margin-left: 20px;" src="img/arancini.webp" alt="">
            <p>There’s a never-ending debate that divides Sicily between those who call it arancino and those who insist the correct spelling is arancina. But despite the gender of this popular Italian street food, it’s undeniably a must-try when in Italy, and especially in Sicily, its land of origin.Usually, the female version arancina is round shaped like the orange, the fruit that supposedly inspired the name, while the male version arancino is slightly conical, a shape that is said to be inspired by the Etna volcano.The traditional recipe is pretty much the same: a ball of rice covered in breadcrumbs and deep-fried, with a heart of tasty ragù (tomato sauce with minced meat), peas and “caciocavallo” cheese. While the recipe is traditionally Sicilian, arancini are popular all over Italy. They come with many different fillings, from ham and mozzarella cheese to spinach and mozzarella, or even pistachio if you’re in the Sicilian town of Bronte.</p>
            <h3>CALZONE</h3>
            <img style = "width: 50%; margin-top: 40px; margin-left: 20px;" src="img/calzone.webp" alt="">
            <p>Simply put, a calzone is a pizza folded in two and stuffed with various fillings, from ham and cheese to vegetables, ricotta, parmesan, and even eggs. The calzone originates in the region of Campania, somewhere around the 18th century. In Naples, it was commonly referred to as a folded pizza. The traditional calzone recipe is oven-baked, though certain regions have their own version of it, like the Apulian panzerotti. However, the two are quite different and should not be mistaken for one another. A traditional calzone does not contain tomato sauce. You’ll find the calzone pretty much everywhere, though it’s more common in the southern regions of Italy, from Lazio to Campania, Basilicata, and Sicily. But if you want to try the true calzone, head to Naples and its surrounding areas.</p>
            <h3>FARINATA</h3>
            <img style = "width: 50%; margin-top: 40px; margin-left: 20px;" src="img/farinata.webp" alt="">
            <p>Made from chickpea flour, farinata is a typical dish in the region of Liguria, in northern Italy where it’s also known as fainà. The dish is renowned also in other northern regions of Italy, such as Tuscany, where it’s usually called cecìna, or torta di ceci (chickpea cake).</p>
