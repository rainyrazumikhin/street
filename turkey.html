                    <p>Turkey’s cuisine is wide and varied, from revived Ottoman dishes to the many recipes of the country’s many regions. Of course, one of the much-loved food categories in Turkey is also the delicious street food, and while it may not be so healthy, it is delicious (especially after a night out on the town).</p> <br><br><br><hr><!--source: https://theculturetrip.com/europe/turkey/articles/the-best-turkish-street-foods-you-need-to-know-about/-->

            <h3>SİMİT</h3>
            <img style = "width: 50%; margin-top: 40px; margin-left: 20px;" src="img/simitçi.jpeg" alt="">
            <p>It’s a well-known fact that even the most elite of Istanbulites have a hard time resisting the tantalising scent of this freshly baked, molasses-dipped and sesame-crusted dough. Turkey’s answer to the American bagel, simit is a staple of breakfasts on-the-go. Even day-old simit has its use as seagull feed.</p>
            <h3>BALIK EKMEK</h3>
            <img style = "width: 50%; margin-top: 40px; margin-left: 20px;" src="img/balıkekmek.webp" alt="">
            <p>The number two most popular street food in the city is indisputably balık-ekmek, better known as the fish sandwiches that are impossible to ignore anytime you’re near the Karaköy or Eminönü shore. You might be tempted to sit down at any one of the restaurants below the Galata Bridge to feast on these tasty sandwiches, but take it from the locals: the balık-ekmek you’re served at a table is just not the same as the one you enjoy on your feet.</p>
            <h3>MİDYE DOLMA</h3>
            <img style = "width: 50%; margin-top: 40px; margin-left: 20px;" src="img/midyedolma.jpeg" alt="">
            <p>More of a snack than a meal, midye dolma is none other than mussels on the half shell, mixed with spicy rice and served with a squeeze of lemon juice, served right out of a tray on every other street corner in Taksim at night. The trick with midye dolma is to keep eating as many as the seller gives you until you feel half-full and then stop. Otherwise, by the time the rice expands in your stomach and your brain receives the message that you’re full, you might look down to find that you’ve spent upwards of 20 TL – and worse, you just might start to feel too full.</p>
            <h3>TAVUK PİLAV</h3>
            <img style = "width: 50%; margin-top: 40px; margin-left: 20px;" src="img/tavukpilav.jpeg" alt="">
            <p>Ever thought you’d eat chicken and rice on a street corner? Probably not, but in Istanbul, that counts as lunch for a greater number of people than you’d imagine. It’s fast, hot and filling. It’s easy to spot the men selling it in glass-covered carts around town, but locals swear that there’s something special about the cart located right in front of İstanbul Manifaturacılar Çarşısı in Unkapanı.</p>
            <h3>KESTANE</h3>
            <img style = "width: 50%; margin-top: 40px; margin-left: 20px;" src="img/kestane.jpeg" alt=""> <!--src: https://yummyistanbul.com/street-food-istanbul/-->
            <p>MA street food can’t get any simpler than this; it is just chestnuts roasted on a grill with their skin on! While there may not be any meat present, a chestnut kebab is nonetheless an outstanding street food in Turkey. It is healthy street food, which you can find at any time of the day. Especially during fall and winter, the streets of Istanbul are full of certified peddlers selling roasted hot chestnuts. In winter, chestnuts will be fresh and tastier.</p>
            <h3>ISLAK HAMBURGER</h3>
            <img style = "width: 50%; margin-top: 40px; margin-left: 20px;" src="img/ıslakhamburger.jpeg" alt=""> <!--src: https://yummyistanbul.com/street-food-istanbul/-->
            <p>These steamed burgers in Istanbul are unlike any you’ve ever had before. Beef patty and soft white buns are flavored with a garlic and tomato sauce and then left to sweat inside a steam box. In this way, the burgers are always kept slightly wet until served to a customer. They are tastier as they steamed longer. These delicious and quite easy-to-eat wet burgers are popular food after a long night of drinking or partying. You can find many corner shops selling wet burgers around Taksim square.</p>
